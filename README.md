I developed this project as an Insight Health Data Science Fellow in June 2018.  The goal was to develop a tool to help doctors improve the accuracy of urinary tract infections (UTI) based on measurements that can be obtained during an office visit.  The minimum viable product associated with this project is called Yoot Assess: Improving UTI Assessment in the Clinic.  The online tool can be temporarily found at www.yootassess.online.  The details outlining the project and model selection and testing can be found in the about.txt file.

About me:
I received my PhD in Infectious Disease from UC Berkeley, where I used basic and functional genomics to elucidate the stress-induced transcriptional changes in metabolic pathways of pathogenic bacteria after lethal antibiotic exposure. I also worked in a multi-laboratory, NIH-funded consortium to develop a diagnostic device to rapidly detect pathogenic bacteria and associated antibiotic resistance profiles directly from urine and blood samples.
